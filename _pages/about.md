# üñã About Me

My research interests include computational chemistry, materials science, and machine learning. Specifically, I focus on accelerating molecular dynamics simulations using neural network potentials (NNPs) and exploring novel materials for energy applications. I am passionate about leveraging machine learning to solve complex problems in materials discovery and optimization. My academic journey has been enriched by hands-on experience in research projects that bridge advanced computational techniques with real-world applications.
